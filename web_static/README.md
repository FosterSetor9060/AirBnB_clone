HNBN

üìù Descripci√≥n
Airbnb is an online platform that connects people who have a home to offer, with people who need a place to stay temporarily.

The first stage of the project was where we started to create The AirBnB Clone and we created a shell to manage the AirBnB objects.

This first stage of the project focused on everything related to Python:

Import, Exceptions, Class, Private attribute, Getter / Setter, Class method, Static method, Inheritance, Unittest, Read / Write file, args and kwargs, Serialization / Deserialization and JSON.

Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it‚Äôs time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to ‚Äúdesign‚Äù / ‚Äúsketch‚Äù / ‚Äúprototype‚Äù each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
Style guide
Fake contents
No Javascript
No data loaded from anything
HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

Provide structure and meaning to content by defining that content, such as headings, paragraphs, or images. Es the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

It is a presentation language created to style the appearance of content, using, for example, fonts or colors. Is the styling of your page, the design.
